How do we use it for comparison:
- use it in aligners such as MUSCLE, T-COFEE, CLUSTALW
- use it in BLASTX for better search


Create a file that contains all the sequences
- Align it using each of the different substituion matrices
- Create a tree out of it via NJ or UPGMA

What do we compare?
- Subjectively the alignment itself
- Clustering the data maybe
